title: My Experience with Typescript

Recently, as Javascript has gained an enormous amount of popularity, the language
has been adopted for use in a lot of larger projects. For better or for worse, I think
Javascript is here to stay in one form or another. The good news, in my opinion at least,
is that Typescript is here to bring in some of the more enterprise-level features needed
for managing large projects.

I've only had the opportunity to use it in my hobby project MyDailyStuff so far, but I'm
really enjoying the ease of refactoring and the confidence that I didn't make a silly mistake
in the code after my gulp build step. Perhaps this is because I've done so much C# over the
years, but I never felt slowed down much by the static typing additions. Sure, there was a 
learning curve in working with existing libraries, as well as having to write your own
definitions if you want to full benefits, but once you get rolling I feel a lot more productive. I think it's great being able to just click on a function and _reliably_ jump 
right to the definition.
