This is where I host my semi-technical blog. It isn't meant to be taken very seriously, but I like to think I'm capable of writing something that could be useful to others.

I'm currently a frontend software engineer at Mode. This mostly includes attending meetings, making sure everyone makes me look good, and reading Reddit/Hackernews.
