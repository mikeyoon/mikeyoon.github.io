Ok, so it's just the old platform that's dead, not my blog. It's been a long time since I've updated this blog, or even looked at it. Over the past year I switched to a new startup, and it's been consuming a large portion of my time. Since I haven't been updating this blog, I most certainly haven't been updating LameBlog, my terrible second project in Node.JS. There were a lot of shortcomings in that little project, although it was at least very reliable. With the recent release of Ghost.JS and my lack of interest in fixing LameBlog, I think now is a great time to just use another platform. Hopefully I won't have to switch again anytime soon.

I've learned a lot of interesting things over the last several months that I'd like to write down, but that will have to wait for later.
