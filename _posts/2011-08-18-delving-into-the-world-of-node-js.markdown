Taking the plunge into the world of Node.JS after seeing a lot of buzz about it from startups like Scopely. The compelling thing to me is not so much the language (which is compelling coming from C#), but rather the style the developers of the platform are taking. Everything is very simple and clean, yet contains the powerful features I'm used to having in the .NET platform. The biggest change for me so far is the complete lack of any code intellisense. I understand that there's no good way to get that in JS due to its prototype model, but I do miss it dearly. My first learning application is a simple web instant messaging platform using [Express](http://www.expressjs.com "Express") and [Socket.IO](http://www.socket.io "Socket.IO"). I'm calling it LameIM because it's going to be lame.
