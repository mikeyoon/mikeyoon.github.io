This is where I host my semi-technical blog. It isn't meant to be taken very seriously, but I like to think I'm capable of writing something that could be useful to others.

I'm currently a software engineer at Airware, acting as technical lead for the UI team. This mostly includes attending meetings, making sure everyone makes me look good, and reading Reddit/Hackernews.

This is the fourth platform for my blog. The second was on my own engine (LameBlog) I built to learn NodeJS, and since it was my first project in node and node was pretty rough back then so it was mostly terrible. Hopefully Jekyll works for me for a while.
